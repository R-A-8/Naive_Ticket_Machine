2. The value returned is 0 cents.
3. Even if you insert a lot of money into the machine, as soon as you print a ticket, the balance returns to 0. There are no refunds, even if you insert more money than for one ticket. Even if there isn't enough money in the balance, a ticket will still be printed and the balance returns to 0.
5. Between the tickets of the two TicketMachine objects, the only difference is the price. One ticket will have the price of the first ticket, while the other has the price of the second ticket(ex:10 cents and 85 cents respectively).
